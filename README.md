As part of learning go, I've taken the Pig game from http://golang.org/doc/codewalk/functions/ and evolved it a little bit to get comfortable with the language.

Commit messages have details on steps.

Any and all feedback on how anything I've done can be done better/more idiomatically is welcome and appreciated.
